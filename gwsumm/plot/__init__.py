"""A `Plot` is a representation of an image to be included in the HTML
output a :doc:`tab </tabs>`.

For simple purposes, a `Plot` is just a reference to an existing image file
that can be imported into an HTML page via the ``<img>`` tag.

For more complicated purposes, a number of data plot classes are provided to
allow users to generate images on-the-fly.
The available classes are:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   TimeSeriesDataPlot
   SpectrogramDataPlot
   SegmentDataPlot
   StateVectorDataPlot
   SpectrumDataPlot
   TimeSeriesHistogramPlot
   TriggerTimeSeriesDataPlot
   TriggerHistogramPlot
   TriggerRateDataPlot
